# Canvas Stuff

### To run start you need to install npm-run-all, globally works



Plans:

Some kind of snake game
Something to do with gravity, things falling from the top of the screen to the bottom
Drag and drop elements
Some kind of physics thing? Things hitting eachother?
Maybe a type of drawing app, or at very least the ability to paint on the canvas.

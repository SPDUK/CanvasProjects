#  Quick projects
### To run start you need to install npm-run-all, globally works

Example of random stuff in this repo:
https://spduk.github.io/Quick-Projects

Plans:

- Some kind of snake game (finished)
- Something to do with gravity, things falling from the top of the screen to the bottom
- Drag and drop elements
- Some kind of physics thing? Things hitting eachother?
- Maybe a type of drawing app, or at very least the ability to paint on the canvas.
